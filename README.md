### Hi there 👋

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/distrustME/distrustME/blob/master/assets/animated-logo.gif" alt="Animated Logo" width="256" height="256" />
I'm Julian, currently a Computer Science Student. Most of my actions were made in private repositories. That's the reason why this Readme seems to be pretty empty.
I wanted to focus more on open-source development in the future and help out other developer when i got time available.
